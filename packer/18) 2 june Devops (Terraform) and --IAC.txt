- mostly packer not used for virtual box
- Devloper with git
- create a package format (war,dll,zip,tar)
- Create a cloud image (packer)
- use this image created in various environments (terraform)
- packer and terraform are infra provision tools
- ansible and chef can be used in both
---------------------------------
for another example
- Devloper with git
- create a package format (war,dll,zip,tar)
- Create environments using infra provisioning
- ONLY TERRAFORM
- one approach with multi cloud
- WANT TO PRESERVE EVERY DAYS IMAGES USE PACKER
- IF WE DONT WANT WE CAN GO WITH TERRAFORM,ARM,CLOUD FORMATION
- WHERE TERRAFORM IS USED
	- EX: WE HAVE A JAVA BASED WEB APPLICATION DEPLOY THIS TO TEST ENVIRONMENT
		1) IF THE ENVIRONMENT IS ALREADY PRESENT OR NOT
		2) DO YOU WANT PRESERVE IMAGES
		- IF THE ANSWER IS YES
		- IT IS PACKER+TERRAFORM 
		- IF NO 
		- ONLY TERRAFORM,ARM,CLOUD FORMATION
	- EX: STARTUP COMPANY  NGINX => NODEJS => MONGODB
			- CUSTOMER DEMO
				- 1) SAMPLE DB
				- 2) DEPLOYING APP IN NODEJS
				- 3) CONFIGURE NGINX
					- SOLUTION: PACKER (MYOPTION)
						- WHY DO WE NEED PACKER 
							- DEMO DONT HAPPEN DAILY
							- DEMO HAPPEN ON STABLE ENVIRONMENT
							- WHENEVER WE HAVE STABLE ENVIRONMENT WE PRESERVE THEM WITH PACKER
							- FOR EVERY SPRINT DEMOS WE USE PACKER
    - creating an environments
		- ex: 2 teams
		- 1) works on application logic for payment solutions
		- 2) ecommerce features
		- here we create ST(system testing) environment so that all the features are tested
		- if we use image daily we dont use packer 
		- if we give beta release(image) once in three months so we can use packer here
===========================================================================================
TERRAFORM
- build environments
	- url/ipaddress
	- terraform has five basic blocks
		- provider 
		- resource
		- output
		
		- data source
		- variable
- run tf  => Environmental is created
- it maintain something called as "state"
- state file contains all the information like ec2 machine is created, ip address of the machine and all of the details that we have created is in the state file 
- when ever we try to do again it will check for the state file 
- where will be the state file  is in the same directory
- what if there are 3 persons in different regions then what about the state file 
- put state file in common place like backend like amazon backend or azure backend or shared directory or s3 backend
- DONT MESS WITH STATE FILE
- state file is used for idempotency 
- github is for text files and state is binary file
- in git we put terraform files
- 
=============================================================================================================
- install terraform 
- terraform --help
- terraform apply --help
- first thing is we need terraform init .
- then terraform plan
- then terraform apply
